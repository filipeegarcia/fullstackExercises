### Notes

- On the submissions directory, you can find the implemented exercises. Each folder contains the resolution for one exercise, along with a readMe file with running instructions or necessary explanations.

- My idea was to use Typescript where I could, to demonstrate my knowledge with it. Also, if I had more time, as improvements I would have included unit tests and doc comments.
