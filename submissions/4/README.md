# Exercise 4

For this exercise, I used typescript to solve the problem, so you can review my resolution on the file `index.ts`.

To run the code, just execute `node index.js`. As you will notice, there's a JS file here. I used the command `tsc index.ts` to compile my file and generate a js output for running purposes.
